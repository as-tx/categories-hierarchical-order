Categories in Hierarchical Order plugin maintains the hierarchical order of categories list in the Category tab under your WordPress Admin Post Editor.

== Description ==

This plugin contains functionality to let you maintain default hierarchical order of categories when you select and save them for a post in your WordPress Admin Post Editor.

The selected category/categories, to which a post belongs, are by default pushed at the top in the Category tab while saving the post. Whereas activating Categories in Hierarchical Order plugin will keep the position of selected category/categories unchanged as per their parent/child relationship.
