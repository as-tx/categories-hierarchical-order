# Categories in Hierarchical Order

Categories in Hierarchical Order plugin maintains the hierarchical order of selected categories in the Category tab under your WordPress Admin Post Editor.

The selected category/categories to which a post belongs, are by default pushed at the top in the Category tab while saving the post. Whereas the plugin keeps the position of selected category/categories unchanged as per their parent/child relationship.

The plugin is available at the [WordPress plugin](https://wordpress.org/plugins/categories-in-hierarchical-order/) repository along with further details. Additionally, you can also check [our official website](https://www.astech.club/wordpress-javascript-jquery-plugins/categories-hierarchical-order/) for the same.
